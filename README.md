### Cyclic redundancy check

CRC which encode messages by adding a fixed-length check value, for the purpose of error detection in communication networks, where they can provide quick and reasonable assurance of the integrity of messages delivered.

However, they are not suitable for protecting against intentional alteration of data.

Implementation is tableless with variable 33bit polynomial and same speed as zlib implementation.
